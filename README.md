This project presents a deep learning-based approach for detecting leukemia using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Leveraging a dataset provided by Mehradaria on Kaggle, we preprocess, visualize, and model the image data using TensorFlow and Keras. The proposed CNN models achieve high accuracy, demonstrating the potential for effective automated leukemia detection. Three models were developed and evaluated, each showcasing various strengths and weaknesses.
